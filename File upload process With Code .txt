Method 2: Best Way – Using Git Commands (Recommended)
Prerequisites (do once on your computer):

Install Git → https://git-scm.com/downloads
Have a GitHub account

Steps (do this every time you want to upload/update a project):

Create empty repository on GitHub (same as above)
Go to GitHub → + → New repository
Give name, keep it empty (no README, no .gitignore)
Create repository
Copy the HTTPS URL (looks like: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)

Open terminal / command prompt / PowerShell / Git Bash
Go to your project folder:

Run these commands one by one:

# 1. Initialize git (only first time)
git init

# 2. Add all files use . or only one file write name example demo.txt
git add .

# 3. Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - first upload of project"

# 4. Connect to GitHub (replace with YOUR url)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# 5. Set main branch name (most common in 2025-2026)
git branch -M main

# 6. Push to GitHub (first time use -u)
git push -u origin main
