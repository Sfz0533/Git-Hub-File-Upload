Method 1: Upload Directly from Browser (Quick & Simple)

Go to https://github.com and log in (create free account if you don't have one).
Click + (top right) → New repository
Fill in:
Repository name (e.g. my-awesome-project)
Description (optional)
Public / Private (Public = anyone can see)
Do NOT tick "Add a README file", ".gitignore", or license (we'll add files ourselves)

Click Create repository
On the empty repo page → click Add file → Upload files
Drag & drop your whole project folder (or click "choose your files" and select everything)
Scroll down → write a commit message like "Initial upload of my project"
Click Commit changes

Done! Your project is now on GitHub.
→ This method has limits (slow with many files, no good history for updates).
